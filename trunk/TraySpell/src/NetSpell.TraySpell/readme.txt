TraySpell 1.0 - System Tray Spell Checker for the Clipboard

What is it? 
-----------
TraySpell is a Windows application the runs in the system tray that can be used to quickly spell check text on the clipboard.  Spell checking can be invoked by a global HotKey or an icon in the system tray.  This allows spell checking from any application by simply coping text to the clipboard. Corrected text will be placed back on the clipboard once spell checking is complete. 

TraySpell also keeps a history of the last 10 text items copied to the clipboard. A history item can be placed back on the clipboard by selecting the text in the Clipboard History menu from the system tray icon.

This project was built and compiled with Visual Studio .net 2003 and the .net 1.1 framework.
