Setting up the NetSpell Web Demo

In order to run the NetSpell web demo, you need to create two IIS virtual folders. The first virtual is for the visual studio project, the second is for the dictionaries.

Steps ...
1) Create a virtual for the dictionaries.  The path for the dictionary is "%root%\NetSpell\dic"*.  The Virtual should be named dic.

2) Create a virtual for the vs.net project.  The path for the project is "%root%\NetSpell\src\NetSpell.Demo.Web"*.  The virtual should be named NetSpell.

* %root% = the path on your computer to the NetSpell folder
